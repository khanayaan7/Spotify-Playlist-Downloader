Spotify-Playlist-Downloader

To make this work:

1)First download the files on your pc and make sure you have python installed.
2)Create a virtual Environment and make sure you pip install all those required modules like spotipy,dotenv,pandas,youtube_search_youtube_dl,os,csv
3)Make a Spotify Developer account and make a app to get your client id and client secret and put them in the .env file.
4)Just go throught both main.py and download.py and put the required paths.Then put your playlist link and first run main.py then download.py.

Thank You!
